# Deprecated

This module has been deprecated.

The guts of it have moved to noddity-parse-template.

The API bits that you probably want to include have moved to [noddity-render-static](https://www.npmjs.com/package/noddity-render-static), for server-side generation of HTML, and [noddity-render-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/noddity-render-dom), for constructing and updating Ractive objects in the browser.
